# Final Project: CS-UY 3083 Intro to Databases

In this project, we created an airline tickets system. 

There are two types of users of this system â€“ Customers, and Airline Staff (Administrator). 

Using this system, customers can search for flights (one way or round trip), purchase flights ticket, view their future flight status or see
their past flights etc. Airline Staff can add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status.
